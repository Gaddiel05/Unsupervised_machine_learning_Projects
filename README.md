# 🧠 Unsupervised Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of unsupervised machine learning projects I completed as part of the **"Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass"** on **Udemy**, organized by **Pierian Training**.

## 📚 Course Overview

The course covers a wide range of data science and machine learning concepts using Python, with a hands-on approach to solving real-world problems.

These projects specifically focus on **unsupervised learning**, including:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- DBSCAN

> 💡 The purpose of this repository is to reinforce my learning and to share the implementation of key concepts with the community.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project is organized in its own Jupyter notebook and typically includes:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Preprocessing
- Model building
- Evaluation and insights

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🙏 Acknowledgements
